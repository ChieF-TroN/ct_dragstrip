Update from 3.1 to 3.2
- Fixed randomized timers for each race.
- Removed cfg.randomTime

Update from 3.0 to 3.1
- Added Betting system - compatible with vRP, ESX, QBCore, and Standalone.
- Added Framework varible in config.
- Added Betting Command variable in config.
- Betting system is in a pool format, you will win the percentage of the total bet for your lane determined by how much you put in. 
Example: Left lane has 2 bets, 500$ each, and right lane has 1 bet 500$. Left Lane wins, the pot is split between the 2 500$ bets, 50/50.
Example2: Left lane has 2 bets, first bet 250$, second bet 750$, right lane has 1 bet, 1000$. Left lane wins, pot is split, 25/75. So you'd get your original bet back + whatever percentage you put in.
